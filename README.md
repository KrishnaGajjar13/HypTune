Welcome to ParamForge, it is a framework providing Bi-level Optimization for hyperparameter tuning of a model, currently working on ANN, CNN, and RNN.
I am using technologies like Python, Flask, Torch, Tensorflow for backend logic and currently working on the project's front-end using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript.
